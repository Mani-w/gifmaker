# gifmaker
## Info:
Gui made in TKinter for moviepy to convert videos to GIFs.</br>
You can set gif resolution, start and end point, and specify frames per second.</br>

The app eeds both moviepy and tkinter, install these:
<pre>
pip install moviepy
sudo apt install python3-tk
</pre>
The app is maily created for linux and is a bit buggy on Windows.</br>
I didn't get the executable to work properly for windows yet.</br>
Shift+right click in the folder and "open powershell window here" and run "python gifmaker.py" is the easiest way to run it on windows.</br>

On Ubuntu "chmod u+x gifMaker.py" and changing "Behavior" -> "Executable Text Files" in Filemanager Preferences to "Run them" or "Ask what to do"(recommended).</br>
## Preview:
#### When starting the app you get to choose what file to convert and where to save it. You can also set a name for the GIF.

#### When a video file has been selected you get to set the start point, end point, FPS and the resolution of the GIF.

#### After that you can click the "Convert!" button to start the convertion (or really creation of the GIF). You'll get an output below the cockatiel when it is completed.
